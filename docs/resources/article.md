# Why do I need to clear my browser cache?
## What is Cache?
When you visit the Data Design dashboard, your browser stores the files (web pages, text, images and other media) used to run the web application on your hard drive or phone storage. This is a positive thing, as it helps speed up your web browsing experience by eliminating the need to download the same static resources over and over as you browse around a web page.

Cached data in the browser sounds great, so why do you ever have to clear it?

## Why Do You Have to Clear Cache?
You certainly don't have to, not as a regular part of computer or smartphone maintenance, anyway. However, a few good reasons to clear cache come to mind.
1. There are changes in the dashboard but you’re unable to see that changes because your browser is still serving up the cached version of that resource.
2. Clearing your cache forces your browser to retrieve the newest copy available from the website, something that should happen automatically but sometimes does not.
3. You might also want to clear the cache if you're experiencing issues like “404 errors” or “502 errors” (among others), sometimes indications that your browser's cache is corrupted.

For those reasons, a good first step whenever you encounter an issue [on the dashboard] is to clear your browser cache. It won’t always fix the issue – but it is an important first diagnostic step to rule out before you assume that a more complicated issue is causing problems.


## How to Clear Cache?
## In Chrome
1. On your computer, open Chrome.
2. At the top right, click More.
3. Click `More tools` and then `Clear browsing data`.
4. At the top, choose a time range. To delete everything, select `All time`.
5. Next to "Cookies and other site data" and "Cached images and files," check the boxes.
6. Click `Clear data`.

## In Mozilla Firefox
1. Click the menu button and select `Preferences`.
2. Select the `Privacy & Security` panel.
3. In the `Cookies and Site Data` section, click `Clear Data`.
4. Remove the check mark in front of *Cookies and Site Data*.
5. With *Cached Web Content* check marked, click the `Clear` button.
6. Close the *about:prefences* page. Any changes you've made will automatically be saved.

    Tip: Here's another way to clear the Firefox cache:
    Click the Library button, click `History` and click `Clear Recent History`…. Next to **Time range to clear**, choose **Everything** from the drop-down menu, select **Cache** in the items list, make sure other items you want to keep are not selected and then click the `OK` button.

## In Microsoft Edge
To clear cache and cookies when using Microsoft Edge, follow the steps detailed below:
1. Click on the `...` menu button situated in the upper right corner.
2. Click on **Settings**.
3. Under **Clear browsing data**, click on **Choose what to clear**.
4. Check the boxes next to **Cookies and saved website data** and **Cached data and files**.
5. Click on **Clear**.

## In Safari on Mac
1. In the Safari app on your Mac, choose History > Clear History, then click the pop-up menu.
2. Choose how far back you want your browsing history cleared.

When troubleshooting issues with the dashboard, after clearing your browser's cache and cookies, exit your browser completely before attempting to access the dashboard again. In Windows, close all your browser windows; in Mac OS X, quit (Command-q) your browser.
