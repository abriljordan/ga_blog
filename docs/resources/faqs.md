## Can I download the reports as a PDF?
Yes. You can download reports as a PDF. Go to _**[Share and Download](/working-with-dashboard/share-download.md)**_

## Why am I getting an error that the server is taking too long when loading dashboard?
Apparent delays downloading from Dashboard's server can be caused by many things, but are often the result of antivirus software or a firewall used by your organization.  After checking with your own IT administrators, if you are still unable to download the dashboard, please ask the Dashboard Desk for assistance.

## How do I convert a standard user to tech administrator?
To convert a standard user to tech administrator, go to _**[Edit Users](/extending-productivity/manage-users.md)**_ and follow the instructions.

## Can I add alerts to an Indicator?
Yes. Go to _**[Add Alert](/extending-productivity/add-alert-indicator.md)**_ and follow the instructions.

## How many dashboards can I have?
You can have any number of dashboards. We recommend to keep only the dashboards that are relevant to your users.

## What user role should I have to use dashboards?
All users can view dashboards and set up alerts on indicator changes. Only tech administrators can setup a Dashboard.

## How I can provide feedback?
The Data+Design team would love to hear from you. If you have feedback or inquiries, you can provide them within the Data+Design Dashboard page. Click the question mark icon on the lower portion of the dashboard and follow the instructions.

## I can't drill down to the student list - what should I do?
You will not be able to drill unless you have switched to ‘Local View’ ![Local View]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/local-view.png). From the dashboard navigation bar, click 'Global View' ![Global View]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/global-view.png) in order to switch to 'Local View'. If all else fails, please contact tech support.
